# Public Service Demand Forecasting

## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting public service demand using historical service request and demographic data. 
The goal is to support data-driven resource planning, staffing allocation, and operational efficiency for public-sector agencies.

## Problem Statement
Public agencies need accurate demand forecasts to allocate resources efficiently across programs and regions. 
Using historical service data, this project builds forecasting models to identify trends, seasonality, and future demand patterns.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis on service request data
- Engineer time-based and demographic features
- Build and evaluate time-series forecasting models
- Generate insights to support operational planning

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Time Series Modeling (ARIMA / Prophet)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
