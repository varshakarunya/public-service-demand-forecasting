# Public Service Demand Forecasting (California)

## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting public service demand using historical service request data from the state of California. The objective is to identify demand trends and build time-series forecasting models that support data-driven operational planning and resource allocation in the public sector.

The workflow reflects real-world analytics commonly used by government agencies for capacity planning and service optimization.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis on public service request data
- Engineer time-based features and identify seasonal trends
- Build and evaluate time-series forecasting models
- Generate insights to support operational planning decisions

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Time Series Modeling (ARIMA, Prophet)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Methodology
1. Data ingestion and preprocessing
2. Time-based aggregation and trend analysis
3. Forecasting model development
4. Model evaluation using historical comparisons
5. Interpretation of demand patterns and seasonality

## Key Insights
- Public service demand exhibits clear seasonal and monthly trends
- Forecasting models help anticipate peak service periods
- Results can support staffing, budgeting, and resource allocation decisions

## Project Status
Complete

## How to Run
- View notebooks directly on GitHub, or
- Use the "Open in Colab" option for interactive execution
